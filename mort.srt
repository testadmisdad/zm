If I may sir,

133
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,595
I believe I have
skills and ideas...

134
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:53,643
that go well beyond counting
numbers into an adding machine.

135
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:55,881
I have read about this
German fellow, Lilienthal...

136
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,246
I believe he's developed a glider

137
00:11:57,446 --> 00:11:59,016
that could take a
man in the air, sir.

138
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,202
Isn't that amazing?

139
00:12:00,326 --> 00:12:02,449
I mean,
if you were to apply that to this business,

140
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:03,796
it would be revolutionary.

141
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:08,278
Gentlemen. Can I have your attention?
You are all dismissed.

142
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:10,962

146

148

149
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:10,495
Oh I didn't think you
were along for that job.

150
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:12,333

00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:42,883
- My birthday.
- It's not your birthday.

161
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:45,304
Okay, I do have a present.

162
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:47,751
But not just any present.
Oh no.

163
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,030
The most amazing
birthday present ever.

164
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:54,273
This extraordinary machine was originally

165
00:13:54,473 --> 00:13:56,912
created by Leonardo Da Vinci 400 years ago.

166
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:58,983
But the blueprints have
been lost for centuries,

167
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:01,075
until just last week,
on a stormy night...

168
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:04,991
when a sunken pirate ship washed
up on the shores of Nantucket.

169
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:07,180
They found skeletons and treasures...

170
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:13,302
and the blueprints were recovered
by none other than JW Mercantile.

171
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:16,682
The blueprints crossed
my desk very briefly...

172
00:14:16,806 --> 00:14:19,684
but I managed to commit
them to memory...

173
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:22,897
and if I had remembered correctly...

174
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:31,614
Happy birthday, Caroline.

175
00:14:38,581 --> 00:14:42,586
This is a wishing machine.
You tell it your wishes...

176
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:46,338
and it keeps them safe
until they come true.

177
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,970
Even if you forget them,
they are always there.

178
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:53,301
- Can I tell a wish?
- Step right up. Go ahead.

179
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:59,668
- I wish to marry Santa Clause.
- That is a good wish.

180
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:04,774
I wish for ballet slippers.

181
00:15:10,864 --> 00:15:12,867
Hey, that's a good wish too.

182
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,121
What is your wish, Mommy?

183
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,749
I wish...

184
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:26,172
for happiness like this forever.

185
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:28,347
For you and you...

186
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:30,824
and for your father.

187
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,093
- Boring.
<i>- Boring?</i>

188
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,102

- Charles, we're leaving.
- Huh?

198
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:35,705
This bank only wants to lend
money to people with money.

199
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:42,840
What are you looking at
Flop Doodle?

200
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:47,052
Mr. Barnum.

201
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:52,934
This venture you propose
is risky and somewhat bizarre.

202
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:56,337
It's a good bet, it's what it is.
Sir, people don't wanna admit it...

203
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:59,190
but they are fascinated with
the exotic and the...

204
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,567
is why we stare at it.

205
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:03,654
The bank is going to need
substantial collateral.

206
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,160
Of course. I would not
suggest otherwise.

207
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:11,602
The deed and title to my entire
fleet of trading vessels.

208
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:17,002
Why would a bank loan us 10,000 dollars?

209
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,345
Because we put up collateral.

210
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,307
We don't have any collateral.

211
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,559
Sure we do. In the
South China Seas.

212
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:27,288
- In the South China Seas?
- Deep in the South China Seas.

213
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:29,746
And what did we
buy with this loan?

214
00:17:30,663 --> 00:17:33,586
<i>Barnum's American Museum of Curiosity.</i>

215
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:35,296
What kind of museum is it?

216
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:40,167
A place to be transported.

217
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:42,864
A place where people can see
thing they've never seen before.

218
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:45,639
- Wax figures?
- Yeah.

219
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:47,557
They are all the
rage in Europe. Look.

220
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:49,877
Marie Antoinette with the sore throat.

221
00:17:49,977 --> 00:17:52,072
Napoleon. Come here.
You see?

222
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:54,896
You have already met some of the most
famous folks from the history.

223
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:56,460
But they are not all wax.

224
00:17:56,785 --> 00:18:00,134
This is the Great O'Malley.

225
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:02,696
Master of sleight of hand,
the king of deception.

226
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:06,499
- You don't look like a magician.
- I am a thief.

227
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:09,524
A very good thief.
I caught him taking my watch.

228
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,041
- You see?
- An elephant.

229
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:12,478
Not just any elephant.

230
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:14,347
I'll get you something
real nice to say the word.

231
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:16,831
- Thank you.
- Oh yeah. This is a ten ton bulls...

232
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,117
straight from the plains of Africa.

233
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:20,426
And, look at that.

234
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:24,943
- The tallest giraffe in the world.
- Can I climb up its leg?

235
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:26,513
Absolutely no. OK.

236
00:18:27,097 --> 00:18:31,632
- Now, I know how it looks.
- If you didn't, I would be worried.

237
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:33,077
I mean it just needs a little work..

238
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:35,081
The loan has to be paid
back every month.

239
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,754
Oh yeah, we're gonna pay.
We just need customers.

240
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:38,653
- Hundreds of them.
- We're gonna get them.

241
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:44,659

It is one hour of your time, sir...

243
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,285

245
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,990
Surely not for the fainted heart.
I can tell you that you'll love it.

Welcome to the Barnum Museum,
where everyone...

251
00:19:09,703 --> 00:19:10,819
How many tickets?

252
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:13,228
- Three.
- Three?

253
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,048
Daddy.

254
00:19:44,508 --> 00:19:46,010
Daddy?

255
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:55,248
- You sell anymore tickets today?
- A few. Yeah.

256
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:58,607
Most of 'em was
rushing home, it's Friday.

257
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:02,026
We sold a few.

258
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:06,918
I think you have too many dead
things in your museum daddy.

259
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:08,096
Do you?

260
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:11,536
She is right.
You need something alive.

261
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:18,889
- Go to sleep, both of you.
- Something sensational.

262
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:22,448
- That is a big word.
- That's your word.

263
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:25,510
Something that isn't stuffed.

264
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:29,425
- Like a mermaid.
- Or a unicorn.

265
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:34,365
<i>- Unicorns aren't real.
- Well, mermaids aren't real either.</i>

266
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:03,179
You must be Gertrude Stratton.

267
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:04,974
I am looking for your son.

268
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:06,681
I don't have a son.

269
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:09,180
The hospital record says you do.

270
00:21:09,182 --> 00:21:11,473
Charles, right? Age 22?

271
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,262

272
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,560
P. T Barnum.
At your service.

273
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:39,970
I'm putting together a show...

274
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:41,463
and I need a star.

275
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:44,215
You want people
to laugh at me.

276
00:21:44,217 --> 00:21:47,393
Well, they are laughing anyway, kid.
So, might as well get paid.

277
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:58,634
I see a soldier.
No, a general...

278
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:02,295
riding across the stage
with a sword and gun and...

279
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:06,153
and the most beautiful
uniform ever made.

280
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:08,174
People will come from
all over the world

281
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:10,219

they won't laugh.

282
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:17,709

291
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:07,008
It's you, isn't it?

292
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:11,429
- Sir, I'll have to ask you to leave.
- You are so talented, blessed...

294
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:17,991

- Trapeze. OK.

416
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:59,607
Ah, Mr. Bennett from the Herald.

417
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:01,810
Come to take in
another show, huh?

418
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:03,177
Tell me, Mr. Barnum,

419
00:31:03,377 --> 00:31:07,270
does it bother you
that everything you're selling is fake?

420
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,435
Do these smiles seem fake?

421
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:12,113
It doesn't matter where they come from.
The joy is real.

422
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:13,770
So you are a philanthropist?

423
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,453
Well, hyperbole isn't the worst crime.

424
00:31:16,455 --> 00:31:19,683
Men suffer more from imagining
too little than too much.

425
00:31:19,685 --> 00:31:22,111
The creed of a true fraud.

426
00:31:23,107 --> 00:31:25,521
Mr Bennett,
when was the last time you smiled?

427
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:27,653
Or had a good laugh?
A real laugh.

428
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:32,518
A theater critic who can't
find joy in the theater.

429
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,366
Now who is the fraud?

430
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:38,954
Oh, Mr. Bennett.

431
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:42,600
That word you used
to describe my show,

432
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,786
has a nice ring to it.

433
00:31:48,729 --> 00:31:50,623
<i>P.T. Barnum's Circus.</i>

434
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:56,055
This way.

435
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:59,247
Don't you think there is enough
'blind trust' in my life?

436
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:02,939
Well, isn't that what makes it fun?
Keep coming. Okay.

437
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,687
Are you ready?

438
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:13,450
- Is it?
- It is.

439
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,907
Come on.
Let's go.

440
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:19,577
Push.

441
00:32:24,707 --> 00:32:26,460
Helen, that's for you.

442
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:32,754
And, Caroline,
this is for you.

443
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:42,406
There is a ballet school
right down the street.

444
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:44,078
Just past your parents' house.

445
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:48,268
Don't tell me you bought this house

446
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,768
just to rub my parents'
noses in your success.

447
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,273
That was not the only reason.

448
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:56,957
This is the life I promised you.

449
00:32:57,157 --> 00:32:58,394
Shall we?

450
00:32:58,594 --> 00:33:00,865
Phin...

451
00:33:00,993 --> 00:33:04,148
It's beautiful, but we
don't need all of this.

452
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,004
It took me 25 years, but...

453
00:33:06,204 --> 00:33:08,444
Welcome home,
Charity Barnum.

454
00:33:46,954 --> 00:33:48,956
- Hello there!
- Barnum is in.

455
00:33:56,419 --> 00:33:58,929
Hey, sweetie, who is that
young man over there?

456
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,836
That is Philip Carlyle.
A bit of a scandal, they say.

457
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:05,945
- His last play was a hit in London.
- Play?

458
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:07,272
Pay good money to

459
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:10,652
watch people stand around and talk for
two hours, and they call me a con man.

460
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:13,772
Ew. What's that smell?
Do you smell that?

461
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:19,027
- Ew, something does smell.
- I know what it is. Peanuts.

462
00:34:28,658 --> 00:34:30,244
I can see it right now.

463
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,291
"Youngest prima ballerina in the
history of the City ballet."

464
00:34:35,248 --> 00:34:38,071
- I'm quitting.
- What? Why would you quit?

465
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,322
I started too late.
I will never catch up.

466
00:34:41,324 --> 00:34:44,107
Caroline, you were the
best dancer on that stage.

467
00:34:44,673 --> 00:34:46,789
What? Do you think
I can't spot talent?

468
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:51,890
Ballet takes years of hard work.
It's not like the circus.

469
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,976
You can't just fake it.

470
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:01,570
She can't quit. No.
No, I mean... She doesn't.

471
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:03,383
She just feels out of place
with the other girls.

472
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:04,941
Well, I should certainly hope so.

473
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:07,565
I have never seen so many
little prima Donnas in my life.

474
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:08,977
Yes, but those prima Donnas are the most

475
00:35:09,177 --> 00:35:10,798
important thing in the
world to her right now.

476
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,224
She'll learn to ignore
them, just like I did.

477
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:14,801
She shouldn't have to.

478
00:35:14,803 --> 00:35:16,645
New York society will never accept us.

479
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:18,930
If they did,
they'd have to stop judging...

480
00:35:18,932 --> 00:35:20,322
and actually do
something with their lives.

481
00:35:20,496 --> 00:35:22,425
This isn't about me.

482
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:26,481
Oh... So it's different than
everything else then?

483
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:30,381
I just want her to be proud
of who she is, of her family.

484
00:35:30,383 --> 00:35:31,968
She is proud.

485
00:35:32,168 --> 00:35:34,532
We don't have to be the Carlyle's.

486
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:42,127
Mr. Carlyle.
You produced this play?

487
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:43,872
Yes I do, indeed.

488
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:46,441
Refunds are available
at front box office.

489
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:48,839
- P.T. Barnum.
- From the circus?

490
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:50,394
Yes. You've been?

491
00:35:50,594 --> 00:35:53,678
God, no. But I've
seen the crowds.

492
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:57,303
People leave your show happier
than when they came in.

493
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:59,723
Which is much more than
I can say from my play.

494
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:02,274
And yet, you have no
trouble selling tickets.

495
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,590
That's because I'm selling virtue.

496
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:08,994
Can I buy you a drink?

497
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:13,295
I want to go after
the carriage straight.

498
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:16,396
Present legitimate acts,
expand our appeal...

499
00:36:16,398 --> 00:36:17,839
go after the snobs.

500
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:20,787
If you only knew how suffocating they are.

501
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:22,369
So come join our circus.

502
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:24,844
You clearly have a flair
for show business.

503
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:27,844
Teach me how to appeal
to the highbrows.

504
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,749
Are you serious?

505
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:33,454
Mr. Barnum, I can not just run off
enter into circus.

506
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:34,838
Why not? Sounds thrilling isn't it?

507
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:37,209
Lets just say that I find
it much more comfortable...

508
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:40,657
- admiring your show from afar.
- Comfort, the enemy of progress.

509
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:42,581
Do you understand that
just associating with you

510
00:36:42,606 --> 00:36:44,002
could cost me my inheritance.

511
00:36:44,143 --> 00:36:45,631
I thought it'd cost you more than that.

512
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,052
You would be risking everything.

513
00:36:47,076 --> 00:36:48,899
But, on the other hand, well,

514
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:51,614
you just might find
yourself a free man.

Hey. No one is buying hats back here.
Get out front, go.

583
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:07,396
WD, Anne, I want to introduce my
newest hire, Mr Philip Carlyle.

584
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:11,054
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah, pleasure.

585
00:41:11,956 --> 00:41:14,767
And what is your act, Mr. Carlyle?

586
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:16,952
I don't have an act.

587
00:41:17,882 --> 00:41:19,339
Everyone has got an act.

588
00:41:25,261 --> 00:41:27,688
- Mr. Barnum.
- Yeah?

589
00:41:28,932 --> 00:41:31,305
You better come see this.

590
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:33,544
Philip, keep up.

591
00:41:37,192 --> 00:41:41,161
- A bit of nasty element.
- They're always is, isn't it?

592
00:41:41,945 --> 00:41:44,811
Nothing draws a crowd
crying like a crowd.

593
00:41:44,813 --> 00:41:47,909
Go home you freaks.

594
00:41:48,784 --> 00:41:50,369
"Shame of the city".

595
00:41:50,371 --> 00:41:53,303
"The protests amend
Mr. Barnum's reputation..."

596
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:56,405
"as a previewer of the
offensive and indecent."

597
00:41:56,407 --> 00:42:00,198
"Offensive and indecent."
Mr. Bennett, I'm blushing.

598
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,999
No, I'm blushing.

599
00:42:02,992 --> 00:42:04,682
What do you care what Bennett thinks?

600
00:42:04,882 --> 00:42:06,445
- He's a prick.
- And a snob.

601
00:42:06,645 --> 00:42:08,611
Yeah, all the snobs in the
New York are reading me.

602
00:42:08,613 --> 00:42:09,812
Does their thinking for them.

603
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:12,162
What ever happened to the
thriving of controversy?

604
00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:14,671
Yeah, well...
Look, hey..

605
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:16,739
- Do you have any thoughts on this?
- Philip.

606
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:19,765
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Helen, come on.

607
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:22,918
"The master of the Household,
has it in the command of the Queen...

608
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,868
To invite Mr. Phineas T
Barnum and his theatrical

609
00:42:26,068 --> 00:42:28,771
troop to a reception at
Buckingham Palace."

610
00:42:29,531 --> 00:42:34,631
- The Queen Victoria? Is this real?
- I had to pull a few strings.

611
00:42:34,873 --> 00:42:37,390
If you want society to accept you,

612
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,773
you may as well start
at the very very top.

613
00:42:42,044 --> 00:42:44,439
Are we all invited?

614
00:42:52,474 --> 00:42:56,779
I guess I'll just have to tell
the queen either all of us go

615
00:42:56,979 --> 00:42:58,438
or none of us will.

616
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:06,612
The Queen of England.
Can't get much better than that.

617
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:17,311
- Why aren't we in tails?
- We are the entertainment.

618
00:43:17,313 --> 00:43:18,791
I don't see you in a costume.

619
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:27,292
<i>Your Majesty, Mr Phineas
T Barnum and his...</i>

620
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:30,926
<i>Oddities from America.</i>

621
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:36,095
<i>Is that real?</i>

622
00:43:49,152 --> 00:43:53,281
Your Majesty,
may I present Mr Barnum.

623
00:43:53,824 --> 00:43:56,035
The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum.

624
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:59,799
And I've heard all about
your little colonel

625
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:01,694
from my friends in America.

626
00:44:01,997 --> 00:44:04,193
General, ma'am.

627
00:44:04,393 --> 00:44:06,271
You are even smaller
than I imagined.

628
00:44:06,273 --> 00:44:09,759
Well, you are not exactly reaching
the top self yourself sweetheart.

629
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,738
Ah, that went well.

630
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,942
<i>- Your Majesty.</i>
- Philip.

631
00:44:38,156 --> 00:44:39,741
Miss Jenny Lind.

632
00:44:43,328 --> 00:44:45,791
<i>She is really luminous.</i>

633
00:44:47,877 --> 00:44:51,389
- Who is that?
- The opera singer.

634
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:54,122
Singer, huh?

635
00:44:54,884 --> 00:44:57,843
She is the most famous
performer in all of Europe.

636
00:44:57,967 --> 00:45:00,470
She has sold out La Scala
a dozen times.

637
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:03,015
Not to mention
the French Opera.

638
00:45:04,893 --> 00:45:06,559
<i>Striking.</i>

639
00:45:10,156 --> 00:45:11,612
- What are you doing?
- Following you...

640
00:45:11,614 --> 00:45:13,265
so you can introduce
me to Miss Lind.

641
00:45:13,465 --> 00:45:14,536
- Introduce you?
- Yeah.

642
00:45:14,538 --> 00:45:15,542
I don't know her.

643
00:45:15,642 --> 00:45:17,092
Everybody knows her.
You just said so yourself.

644
00:45:17,094 --> 00:45:18,811
Yeah, exactly. You don't just
walk up to someone right now.

645
00:45:18,911 --> 00:45:21,437
Why not? We are presentable.
She is a person.

646
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:27,367
Miss Lind.
My name is Phillip Carlyle.

647
00:45:29,457 --> 00:45:32,721
And this extraordinary
gentleman next to me...

648
00:45:32,723 --> 00:45:35,618
Phineas Taylor Barnum.
The pleasure is mine.

649
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,685
Of course, you are the American.
I believe I might have heard of you.

650
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:41,289
Oh well, If you've heard of
me all the way over here,

651
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,179
I must have been doing
something right.

652
00:45:43,555 --> 00:45:45,996
That, or something very wrong.

653
00:45:45,998 --> 00:45:49,274
In the world of publicity there
is hardly any difference.

654
00:45:49,276 --> 00:45:52,161
I believe those are the words
of a scoundrel, Mr Barnum.

655
00:45:52,163 --> 00:45:57,244
A showman, Miss Lind, just a showman.
The best on my side of the Atlantic.

656
00:45:57,316 --> 00:46:02,520
- If you just say so yourself.
- I do, but I don't have to.

657
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:06,699
Oh, no, no.
He is one of the best.

658
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:09,742
That's very kind of you.
Miss Lind, let me get to the point.

659
00:46:09,744 --> 00:46:12,209
I would like to bring you to New York.
And if you agree...

660
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:15,537
I will make you the most famous singer
not in Europe but in the entire world.

661
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:18,837
And have you heard me sing?

662
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:21,677
- Absolutely.
- No, I haven't.

663
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,834
But like mine, your
reputation precedes you...

664
00:46:24,836 --> 00:46:28,458
and well, I trust your reputation
more than my own taste, so...

665
00:46:28,555 --> 00:46:30,477
I have never been to America.

666
00:46:31,433 --> 00:46:33,033
You will sing in the grandest theater...

667
00:46:33,103 --> 00:46:35,645
with the finest orchestra in the
greatest city on earth.

668
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:40,239
"Jenny Lind".
"One night only." Or maybe two.

669
00:46:40,241 --> 00:46:44,608
And at 20% at the gate, it will
be a queen's ransom for your..

670
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,034
I gave most of my
earnings to charity, Mr Barnum...

671
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:48,206
to orphans and widows.

672
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:50,851
"Voice of a nightingale,
Heart of an Angel."

673
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:53,587
That's brilliant. I mean the press
will go crazy with that story.

674
00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:54,693
That's not a story.

675
00:46:54,893 --> 00:46:56,984
May I ask you something,
Mr. Barnum?

676
00:46:56,986 --> 00:46:58,139
Anything.

677
00:46:59,423 --> 00:47:00,903
Why me?

678
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:06,677
People come to my show for the
pleasure of being hoodwinked.

679
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:10,120
Just once, I would love to
give them something real.

680
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,478
Miss Lind.

681
00:47:29,574 --> 00:47:34,092
Everyone is here. Look at this.
Even the Winthrops.

682
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:38,736
- Are you happy?
- I will be, if this works.

683
00:47:39,043 --> 00:47:41,669
Oh, God, I hope she can sing.

684
00:47:43,795 --> 00:47:46,971
- What's taking her so long?
- They are still taking their seats.

685
00:47:46,973 --> 00:47:50,532
Speaking of which. Tom and Lettie,
the others, they just arrived.

686
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,870
- What?
- Where should I put them? Your box?

687
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,648
- That box? No, that's pretty visible.
- Visible?

688
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,680
The acoustics are actually
better in the standing room.

689
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,970
That's where they should be.

690
00:48:00,643 --> 00:48:03,745
- Miss Lind is ready now.
- OK. Thank you. Thank God.

691
00:48:05,232 --> 00:48:06,902
<i>This is so beautiful.</i>

692
00:48:07,026 --> 00:48:09,593
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Yes.

693
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,679
I love it.

694
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:27,384
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

695
00:48:34,384 --> 00:48:40,356
I recently had the privilege of
hearing the most divine voice...

696
00:48:40,358 --> 00:48:43,106
- I've ever heard.
- Suddenly he's a connoisseur.

697
00:48:43,108 --> 00:48:46,664
Now, I know that sounds
like Barnum humbug...

698
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:49,547
but I have a 100 bottles of
good champagne on ice that says

699
00:48:49,747 --> 00:48:52,131
that this is not just
another sideshow novelty.

700
00:48:53,863 --> 00:48:57,759
May I present, the Swedish Nightingale...

701
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,392

748
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,182
<i>Bravo.</i>

749
00:53:00,109 --> 00:53:01,110
<i>Awesome.</i>

750
00:53:12,013 --> 00:53:14,178
Jenny, this is my wife
Charity and our girls.

751
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,287
Of course, and I've heard
so much about you.

752
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,603
And your father tells me
you are a fan of the ballet.

753
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:21,521
- Yes, I'm studying ballet.
- Oh, are you?

754
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:24,524
- Of course I am.
- Of course she is.

755
00:53:24,648 --> 00:53:27,514
- And what about you, Helen?
- You look like a princess, ma'am.

756
00:53:28,489 --> 00:53:33,150
I have to admit, Barnum,
she is remarkable.

757
00:53:33,152 --> 00:53:36,262
Enough to bring joy to the
most joyless critic, isn't she?

758
00:53:37,077 --> 00:53:39,591
And in the hands of a real
previewer of the art...

759
00:53:39,593 --> 00:53:41,918
she could be something
in this country.

760
00:53:42,418 --> 00:53:44,796
Shame she's fallen in with you.

761
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:47,930
You really are better on the page,
Mr Banner. How does that is to believe.

762
00:53:47,932 --> 00:53:50,578
<i>Oh, Mr. Barnum? I would
love to meet Miss Lind.</i>

763
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,080
<i>And you will meet miss Lind
if you just give me a moment...</i>

764
00:53:53,082 --> 00:53:54,305
- Phineas.
- Yes.

765
00:53:54,307 --> 00:53:57,496
You've done well.

766
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:00,954
Thank you.

767
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:05,480
Allow me to introduce you.

768
00:54:08,736 --> 00:54:12,021
Excuse me, Jenny.
I would like you to meet Charity's parents.

769
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:14,794
- Mr and Mrs Hallett.
- Ah, pleasure.

770
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:17,664
- How do you do? Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

771
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:19,573
- Mother.
- Hello dear.

772
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:24,058
- Are these...
- Yes, yes, those are your granddaughters.

773
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,516
- Phineas, not here.
- Not here?

774
00:54:26,518 --> 00:54:28,474
You are afraid that
I'm gonna embarrass your

775
00:54:28,674 --> 00:54:30,452
parents in front of their
fancy friends?

776
00:54:30,454 --> 00:54:32,471
I really don't think
that I have that power.

777
00:54:32,671 --> 00:54:34,092
An insignificant man like me...

778
00:54:34,216 --> 00:54:37,697
was clearly destined
to lead an insignificant life.

779
00:54:38,472 --> 00:54:41,650
All that fortune and still
just a tailor's boy.

780
00:54:42,432 --> 00:54:43,725
Get out.

781
00:54:48,398 --> 00:54:51,025
Well, Phineas...

782
00:54:51,149 --> 00:54:53,733
I believe that I told
you that free champagne

783
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:55,460
is a recipe for disaster.

784
00:54:56,153 --> 00:54:57,198
Charity.

785
00:54:57,298 --> 00:55:00,614
Now would everyone please
raise their glasses?

786
00:55:01,495 --> 00:55:04,467
To Mr Barnum, who showed
once and for all...

787
00:55:04,537 --> 00:55:09,108
that a man's station is limited
only by his imagination.

788
00:55:10,836 --> 00:55:13,005
- To Barnum.
- Thank you.

789
00:55:13,169 --> 00:55:14,880
To Mr Barnum.

790
00:55:17,594 --> 00:55:19,399
Thank you.

791
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,641
It's hard to understand wealth and
privileges when you're born into it.

792
00:55:26,475 --> 00:55:29,398
I sometimes don't feel
like I belong here.

793
00:55:30,563 --> 00:55:32,024
You?

794
00:55:33,357 --> 00:55:35,473
I was born out of wedlock

795
00:55:35,673 --> 00:55:38,889
and that brought
shame upon my family.

796
00:55:38,891 --> 00:55:41,315
And life always manages
to remind me

797
00:55:41,515 --> 00:55:42,816
that I don't deserve
a place in this world.

798
00:55:42,818 --> 00:55:47,779
And that leaves a hole that
no ovation can ever fill.

799
00:55:52,968 --> 00:55:54,009
Mr. Phineas.

800
00:55:54,138 --> 00:55:56,712
- Lord, that lady can sing.
- I know.

801
00:55:56,974 --> 00:55:58,894
Thinks she likes a man in uniform?

802
00:55:58,896 --> 00:55:59,927
I'm sure she does.

803
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:02,019
What are you doing here?
You got a show in an hour, OK?

804
00:56:02,021 --> 00:56:05,084
That's enough time for us to have
at least three drinks, right? Come on.

805
00:56:05,086 --> 00:56:06,612
- No no. Lettie.
- What?

806
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,359
It's very crowder in here, okay?
And I can't have you mingling.

807
00:56:10,361 --> 00:56:12,014
Who's gonna pay admission

808
00:56:12,214 --> 00:56:13,714
if you are out there for
all the world to see.

809
00:56:13,716 --> 00:56:15,478
- Have a great show.
- Wait...

Why can't you just put

01:00:13,847 --> 01:00:15,456
Why do you need t
tour the country?

866
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:17,464
Why did Napoleon
march on Russia?

867
01:00:17,592 --> 01:00:18,718
Napoleon was defeated.

868
01:00:18,842 --> 01:00:21,325
Napoleon didn't have a 60 piece orchestra.

869
01:00:21,525 --> 01:00:23,003
A 60 piece orchestra.

870
01:00:23,005 --> 01:00:24,969
Just get the cheapest musicians you can,
you watch that.

871
01:00:25,169 --> 01:00:26,312
We still have to aboard them.

872
01:00:26,314 --> 01:00:29,766
Get married ones. They can share a bunk.
O'Malley, that's Caroline's piggy bank.

873
01:00:29,768 --> 01:00:33,591
Costumes sets? Fireworks?
Inside theaters?

874
01:00:33,988 --> 01:00:35,256
That's genius.

875
01:00:35,456 --> 01:00:38,887
No. These are the most famous
theaters in the country.

876
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:41,541
- They make you buy their seats in advance.
- Yeah, yeah. I took out a loan.

877
01:00:41,543 --> 01:00:42,786
And we have to pay Jenny?

878
01:00:42,788 --> 01:00:44,175
It was a large loan, okay?

879
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:47,577
You're not gonna see a penny of
profit until your 40th show.

880
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:48,949
41st actually.

881
01:00:49,149 --> 01:00:50,720
You're risking everything
you've built here.

882
01:00:50,722 --> 01:00:51,815
How do you think I build it?

883
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:53,384
We'll have plenty of profits
to go around after this.

884
01:00:53,386 --> 01:00:54,743
- P. T?
- What?

885
01:00:54,745 --> 01:00:56,987
Your attention has been
divided long enough.

886
01:00:56,989 --> 01:00:59,552
Our gate is down, we have
more protesters every day.

887
01:00:59,554 --> 01:01:01,274
You just need to get
people to come back.

888
01:01:01,276 --> 01:01:03,278
"If you haven't been to
Barnum museum lately...

889
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,340
You have not been to
the Barnum Museum."

890
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,703
The come to see you.

891
01:01:06,241 --> 01:01:10,479
Your crazy ideas, your
new acts, the unusual.

892
01:01:10,481 --> 01:01:13,258
Then have you show them your smile.
That would be unusual.

893
01:01:13,259 --> 01:01:15,093
Keep rehearsing.
Just make it very clear that I expect

894
01:01:15,293 --> 01:01:17,092
them to afford you all the
deference you deserve...

895
01:01:17,116 --> 01:01:19,216
And that they should
be nice to you anyway.

896
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:22,600
Ain't that a sight for sore eyes?

897
01:01:22,725 --> 01:01:25,240
- He couldn't even say hello.
- Or goodbye.

898
01:01:25,275 --> 01:01:27,435
He is going on tour.
Sorry guys.

899
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:31,228
Pull yourself together, Carlyle.
Don't you have somewhere to be?

900
01:01:36,491 --> 01:01:37,951
Anne Wheeler.

901
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:40,879
Mr. Barnum said he
left a ticket for me.

902
01:01:44,879 --> 01:01:46,297
I'm sorry.

903
01:01:46,425 --> 01:01:50,355
- I believe this one supposed to be one.
- No, there's meant to be two.

904
01:01:55,518 --> 01:01:57,987
Wasn't sure you'd come if I asked.

905
01:02:02,189 --> 01:02:04,108
<i>Five minutes to curtains.</i>

906
01:02:06,702 --> 01:02:08,903
I've always wanted to
go to the theater.

907
01:02:15,174 --> 01:02:17,575
Phillip, is that you?

908
01:02:18,343 --> 01:02:21,431
Mother. Father.

909
01:02:21,555 --> 01:02:23,478
This is Anne Wheeler.

910
01:02:24,479 --> 01:02:27,749
Phillip, have you no shame?

911
01:02:27,776 --> 01:02:31,126
To associate yourself with that
Barnum business is one thing...

912
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:33,972
but parading around with that elf.

913
01:02:36,411 --> 01:02:37,998
Anne.

914
01:02:46,302 --> 01:02:48,570
How dare you speak
to her like that?

915
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:54,352
- You forget your place, Phillip.
- My place?

916
01:02:54,978 --> 01:02:59,068
Mother, if this is my place, then
I don't wanna be a part of it.

917
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:10,207
Anne.

918
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:16,724
They are small minded people.

919
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:26,366
- Why do you care what they say?
- It's not just them.

920
01:03:27,648 --> 01:03:31,029
Never had somebody look at you
the way your parents looked at me.

921
01:03:32,968 --> 01:03:34,968

Then meeting the queen.

975
01:07:37,316 --> 01:07:40,722
Then bringing Jenny Lind, and
my father the other night.

When will it ever be
enough for you?

977

I am doing this for
Caroline and Helen.

978

They have everything.

01:07:48,568 --> 01:07:49,940
- You don't understand.
- I do.

980
01:07:50,068 --> 01:07:52,075
No. You don't understand!

981
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:54,894
How could you?

982
01:07:57,232 --> 01:07:59,692
My father was treated like dirt.

983
01:07:59,816 --> 01:08:02,035
I was treated like dirt.

984
01:08:02,235 --> 01:08:04,455
My children will not be.

985
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:06,859
You don't need everyone
to love you, Phin.

986
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,524
Just a few good people.

987
01:08:13,648 --> 01:08:15,108
I know that.

988
01:08:24,276 --> 01:08:26,484
- Thank you.
- Sir.

989
01:08:28,524 --> 01:08:30,250
No. Daddy.

990
01:08:30,484 --> 01:08:31,692
Daddy.

991
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,524
Daddy, no. Wait.

992
01:08:34,648 --> 01:08:36,171
- Daddy.
- Go.

993
01:08:36,206 --> 01:08:38,440
Wait, Daddy.

1028
01:11:49,366 --> 01:11:55,678
Miss Lind deserves our nation's highest
esteem and lavish ovations.

1029
01:11:57,192 --> 01:11:59,692
- I mean...
- The world at our feet.

1030
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:03,024
Well, Mr. Barnum.

1031
01:12:04,484 --> 01:12:05,568
This...

1032
01:12:07,192 --> 01:12:08,192
is...

1033
01:12:11,776 --> 01:12:13,940
to making dreams come true.

1034
01:12:14,068 --> 01:12:15,860
Thank you, Jenny.

1035
01:12:28,024 --> 01:12:30,158
It's two hours to curtains.

1036
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,940
I've given you the world, haven't I?

1037
01:12:37,568 --> 01:12:40,470
I, I should go.

1038
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:44,029
I have become a distraction.
I'm sorry, Jenny.

1039
01:12:44,064 --> 01:12:46,701
- You should finish your tour without me.
- What? You're leaving?

1040
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:49,329
- The itinerary is well in hand.
- So that's it.

1041
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:50,860
What do you mean?

1042
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:54,705
I'm just another your acts.

1043
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,692
- Jenny.
- I'm done.

1044
01:12:57,608 --> 01:12:59,911
Jenny, Jenny, please.

1045
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,484
You have to finish the tour.

1046
01:13:01,984 --> 01:13:05,093
- Must I?
- It will ruin me.

1047
01:13:06,608 --> 01:13:08,855
When you're careless
with other people Mr Barnum...

1048
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:10,524
you bring ruin upon yourself.

1049
01:13:10,648 --> 01:13:14,124
- I have risked everything.
- Well, so did I.

1050
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,713

<i>Thank you very much for coming.</i>

1063
01:14:47,845 --> 01:14:49,737
- Say your fancy neighbors.
- What a beautiful show.

1064
01:14:49,761 --> 01:14:51,868
Who enjoyed yourselves? You?

1065
01:14:51,903 --> 01:14:53,348
Tell everyone how much fun you

1066
01:14:53,548 --> 01:14:55,475
had at the circus.
New acts every night.

1067
01:14:55,484 --> 01:14:58,400
Hey, ringmaster.

1068
01:15:00,148 --> 01:15:03,328
Gentlemen, I am gonna
have to ask you to leave.

1069
01:15:03,363 --> 01:15:05,940
This is our town, son.

1070
01:15:06,361 --> 01:15:09,908
We think you should leave,
you and your freaks.

1071
01:15:10,008 --> 01:15:11,875
And yours spooks.

1072
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:13,946
Sir.

1073
01:15:15,108 --> 01:15:16,930
I will only ask once more.

1074
01:15:16,965 --> 01:15:18,623
Then what, boy?

1075
01:15:25,308 --> 01:15:28,143
Attack.

1076
01:15:57,561 --> 01:15:59,002
Daddy.

1077
01:15:59,769 --> 01:16:03,447
- Daddy. Daddy!
- Girls.

1078
01:16:03,653 --> 01:16:06,641
You have grown so much.

1079
01:16:09,099 --> 01:16:10,914
What made you decide
to come back early?

1080
01:16:10,949 --> 01:16:12,497
I missed you.

1081
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:15,980
- That sounds lawful.
- Fire.

1082
01:16:16,081 --> 01:16:20,258
<i>- Out of the way. Fire!
- Hurry, it's coming from the circus.</i>

1083
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:24,713
Girls, stay with me.
Come, quickly.

1084
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,838
Everyone! Stay close.

1085
01:16:38,033 --> 01:16:40,458
Phillip, is everyone out?

1086
01:16:40,493 --> 01:16:43,323
Is everyone okay?
The animals?

1087
01:16:43,357 --> 01:16:44,957
We set them free.
What else could we do?

1088
01:16:45,018 --> 01:16:48,217
- WD, where is Anne?
- Where is Anne?

1089
01:16:48,252 --> 01:16:50,258
No, Phillip.

1090
01:16:50,387 --> 01:16:53,401
No. Stop.
You can not go inside.

1091
01:16:55,443 --> 01:16:58,229
<i>Keep pumping.</i>

1092
01:16:58,353 --> 01:17:00,857
- WD.
- There she is.

1093
01:17:04,946 --> 01:17:06,614
- Phillip.
- Daddy.

1094
01:17:10,206 --> 01:17:12,456
- No dad.
- Daddy.

1095
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,918
No.

1096
01:17:25,901 --> 01:17:27,510
<i>Stay back, please.</i>

1097
01:17:38,618 --> 01:17:40,195
Daddy.

1098
01:17:47,214 --> 01:17:50,818
<i>Stretcher, stretcher.</i>

1099
01:17:51,428 --> 01:17:54,554
He has taken a lot of smoke.
He's still breathing.

1100
01:17:55,828 --> 01:17:56,964
Let's get him on.

1101
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:01,736
Up.

1102
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:39,118
<i>What if we rewrite the stars?</i>

1103
01:18:41,873 --> 01:18:47,115
<i>Say you were meant to be mine?</i>

1104
01:18:49,345 --> 01:18:54,517
<i>Nothing can keep us apart</i>

1105
01:18:59,899 --> 01:19:06,280
<i>you are the one I was meant to find.</i>

1106
01:19:11,437 --> 01:19:12,749
<i>Here we go.</i>

1107
01:19:12,917 --> 01:19:14,920
<i>Come on, straight ahead.</i>

1108
01:19:33,112 --> 01:19:35,689
If you had come to gloat
I wouldn't.

1109
01:19:40,038 --> 01:19:42,995
They caught the thugs
who started the fire.

1110
01:19:43,127 --> 01:19:45,285
I thought you'd like to know.

1111
01:19:55,684 --> 01:19:57,867
I never liked your show.

1112
01:19:58,812 --> 01:20:01,179
But I always thought the people did.

1113
01:20:01,401 --> 01:20:03,528
They do.

1114
01:20:11,622 --> 01:20:13,906
Mind you, I wouldn't call it art.

1115
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:16,153
Of course not.

1116
01:20:16,413 --> 01:20:17,724
But...

1117
01:20:18,968 --> 01:20:23,000
Putting folks of all kinds on stage.

1118
01:20:23,035 --> 01:20:28,802
All colors, shapes, sizes.
Presenting them as equals.

1119
01:20:31,601 --> 01:20:33,888
Another critic might have even called it

1120
01:20:34,088 --> 01:20:36,470
'a celebration of humanity'.

1121
01:20:37,911 --> 01:20:39,502
I would have liked that.

1122
01:20:44,043 --> 01:20:46,573
Well, I hope you'll rebuild.

1123
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:50,632
Thank god for Jenny's tour.
We can borrow off the profits.

1124
01:20:50,667 --> 01:20:51,980
We'll be fine.

1125
01:20:52,015 --> 01:20:53,529
You don't know?

1126
01:21:01,693 --> 01:21:03,194
I'm sorry.

1127
01:21:14,462 --> 01:21:15,672
Charity?

1128
01:21:15,836 --> 01:21:17,129
Oh God, Charity.

1129
01:21:17,258 --> 01:21:18,801
- I am...
- I don't wanna talk to you.

1130
01:21:18,925 --> 01:21:21,538
- Nothing happened.
- Ouch, nothing happened.

1131
01:21:21,573 --> 01:21:23,351
It's on the cover of
every paper in New York.

1132
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:25,888
Because she orchestrated the photo.
I am not in love with her.

1133
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,422
Of course you're not.

1134
01:21:27,457 --> 01:21:29,674
Not with her, not with me,
not with anyone.

1135
01:21:29,709 --> 01:21:31,119
Just you and your show.

1136
01:21:33,236 --> 01:21:34,991
What are you doing?

1137
01:21:36,532 --> 01:21:38,237
I'm going home.

1138
01:21:38,368 --> 01:21:40,087
This is your home.

1139
01:21:43,668 --> 01:21:45,422
The bank..

1140
01:21:46,879 --> 01:21:49,041
They are evicting us.

1141
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:53,289
Why didn't you ask me before?

1142
01:21:54,934 --> 01:21:57,394
I would have said yes.

1143
01:21:57,429 --> 01:22:00,442
I never minded the risk,
but we always did it together.

1144
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:43,182
Figured you'd end up here.
Feeling sorry for yourself?

1145
01:22:59,172 --> 01:23:03,086
Folks if you have come to get paid,
the money's gone. All of it.

1146
01:23:03,514 --> 01:23:05,265
- Nothing left to give...
- Shut up, Barnum.

1147
01:23:05,389 --> 01:23:07,059
You just don't get it.

1148
01:23:08,313 --> 01:23:11,176
Our own mothers were ashamed of us.

1149
01:23:12,482 --> 01:23:14,629
Hid us our whole lives.

1150
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:17,658
Then you pull us out of the shadows.

1151
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:20,781
And now you are giving upon us too.

1157

1250

when I first met you...

1251
01:31:15,899 --> 01:31:17,866
I had an inheritance, claim...

1252

and an invitation to every party in town.

1253
01:31:20,955 --> 01:31:24,708
And now thanks to you.
All that's gone.

1254

All that's left is this friendship, love

1255

01:31:48,746 --> 01:31:51,076
